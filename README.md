# BassConnections_SaeediZwickImplementation
To apply the Bass Connections Energy Data Analytics Lab's rendition of the Saeedi algorithm, please follow the following instructions.  
1. JOYCE describe this: Apply the Feldenschwab segmentation algorithm




2. Open cellarrayoutput. Then change the input in line 1 to the desired file of 
lines that is output from the segmentation step (1). Then run cellarrayoutput.


3. Open Saeedi_EricJoyceCombined, then change the input in line 14 to 
the desired file of lines that is the output from the segmentation step (1).
Tune the other paramters at the top of the page to taste. Then run 
Saeedi_EricJoyceCombined. The output is called finaloutput, and its structure
is described in detail in the comment at the end of Saeedi_EricJoyceCombined.


4. SEBASTIAN describe your process here, starting with the "finaloutput" cell as your first input.
